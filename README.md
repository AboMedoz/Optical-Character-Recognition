# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using CRNN + CTC 

This project is an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** web app built using **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit**.  
It takes an uploaded image, preprocesses it, feeds it through a trained CRNN + CTC-based OCR model, and decodes the predicted text.
